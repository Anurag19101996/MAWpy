# Developing Workflows

restrictions:
- STAYINT is only applied if a user's data comprises data from different sources (e.g., GPS and cellular) with very different uncertainty radius. In this case, DP shall be applied first. 
- STAYCAL or STAYINT cannot be applied prior to the use of either TRACESEG or INCREMENTAL
- OSC can be applied before TRACESEG or INCREMENTAL
- TRACESEG AND INCREMENTAL can be applied together, but can only in one order: TRACESEG first followed by INCREMENTAL, not the other way
- neither TRACESEG or INCREMENTAL shall be applied more than once
- TIME4OSC, STAY_SP_THRESHOLD, STAY_TIME_THRESHOLD, are diagnosis tools used to detect appropriate thresholds to be used in OSC, TRACESEG, INCREMENTAL
